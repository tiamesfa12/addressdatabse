# addressdatabse
In this I made a database using tkinter and implenting sqlite3 with python. I did this to store data in a basic database app where you can collect, save, edit, or delete any records you saved. For example in this basic app, I made a GUI in which you type in a person first and last name, their address, city, state, and zipcode. It is then stored in the database. In a second window you can edit the record incase there was a mistake and store the correct info again. This is just to continue understanding how databases work in python and also learning tkinter from the python language.
